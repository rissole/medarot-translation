# Medarot Translation
A translation tool specifically for translating the Medarot DS game for Nintendo DS. Features include:

* Load/Save of SPT files (script files that define the game's behaviour)
* Basic Translation Memory
* TEX image viewer (game's proprietary image format, only shows greyscale, not fully implemented)
* Detects kind of message and adjusts the GUI accordingly

# Set up
Compile the project. It's vanilla C#.

After that you'll probably want to download the Medarot DS rom from some location on the internet, and extract the SPT files for viewing. There are many tools that can perform this, DSLazy is what I used.
